⚡ Fun fact:  
I once built an Oscar simulator that gives you your post-win fate. It can label you a **global meme** or a **cult avant-garde** genius.  
Also: I have a not-so-secret obsession with post-punk bands (in case the Joy Division t-shirt on profile pic didn't make it clear enough) and linguistic typology.
